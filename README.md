# Beyond 184

For my conference work during the Fall 2017 semester, I have implemented a cellular automata for simulating traffic.

It is based on the Rule 184 CA (hence the name), with enhancements made to add varying speed levels and to make the whole thing work in two dimensions. A detailed explanation of the work done is included in the conference paper (conference.pdf).

This repository includes various versions of the automata, including multiple WIP versions.
